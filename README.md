Font Unit Conversion Tool
===========================

Tool for converting font sizes from one unit to another. 

Units include: px, pt, em and %

NOTES:
- Pixel unit conversions use a baseline font size of 14px; as this is the default font size of most browsers/HTMLframeworks.
- Round up if the first decimel place is 5 or greater; NEVER round down.
