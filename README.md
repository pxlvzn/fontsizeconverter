Font Size Conversion Tool
===========================

Tool for converting font sizes from one unit type to another. 

Unit types include: px, pt, em and %

NOTES:
1.) PX to EM, % and EM, %  to PX conversions use a baseline font size of 16px. As this is the default font size of most browsers.
2.) Round up ONLY when the remainder at the first decimel place is 5 or greater.
3.) NEVER round down.
