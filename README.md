Font Unit Conversion Tool
===========================

Tool for converting font sizes from one unit to another. 

Units include: px, pt, em and %

NOTES:

1.) Pixel unit conversions use a baseline font size of 16px; as this is the default font size of most browsers. This will be adjustable in futre versions.

2.) Round up ONLY when the remainder at the first decimel place is 5 or greater.

3.) NEVER round down.
